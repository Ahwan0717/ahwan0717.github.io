<h2> 1- Social Media Marketing </h2>
<p>
Refinery29 is a news and entertainment media site targeted towards young women. In order to effectively market its content, it makes use of several different social media platforms: Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat, and Pinterest. Refinery29 utilizes its social channels in a clever way, because on Instagram, for example, it has multiple instagram accounts directed towards their audience’s separate interests. One instagram account will focus on fashion (@r29fashion) in particular, while one is suited for their demographic in Germany (@refinery29germany). There are many other accounts on Instagram alongside these ones; this segmentation also applies to Facebook with many different pages users can follow. As a result, Refinery29 can expect improved user loyalty and a decrease in “unfollows”. Another often overlooked technique Refinery29 implements is URL shortening. This comes in handy on Twitter which has limited characters per post. A short link will tempt users even more to click on the link because it looks better than a long, “ugly” link. These links can be crucial to any call to action too, so it’s important that they stand out.  
</p>
<p>
Refinery29 not only spreads itself across well across different social channels, but it also provides a great mix of media: video (original and ones off Youtube), graphic design posts, and branded content. On Facebook, Refinery29 will post its <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2017/03/13/facebook-native-video-gets-10x-more-shares-than-youtube/#506bf45c1c66"target="_blank">videos natively</a>, since Facebook favors videos shared on its platform over other sources such as Youtube. 
  
By dedicating a lot of time on updating Facebook Live and Snapchat Discover, Refinery29 can tap into many users on their mobile devices, and thus increase engagement on their site.
</p>
<h2> 2 - Content </h2>
<p>
Refinery29’s content clearly communicates the purpose of the site. Users can instantly see that the site contains articles with large headlines to read, and while browsing through the site’s header, they can discover articles or videos on topics such as Style, Beauty, Work & Money, Health, Entertainment, Horoscopes, Food, and more. The site header also can direct its audience into buying items from other sites. The female dominated audience is generally interested in the categories Refinery29 provides with keywords such as: Mothership, makeup, nails, weddings, horoscopes, reproductive rights, home & décor, celebs, etc. This is part of Refinery29’s conversion strategy, driving consumers to buy products from other companies. Refinery29 also does this through branded content. For example, a brand called Thalia Sodi sponsored one article headlined <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/best-macys-thalia-sodi-spring-essentials"target="_blank">“7 Spring Buys That Are Major Confidence Boosters”</a> in which the webpage featured all of the clothing along with favorable quotes from the staff. A user can click on the hyperlinked image of the outfit piece and then she is taken into a separate tab in which she can buy it from the original page source. 
</p>
<p>
Another strength found in Refinery29’s content is the number of meaningful internal links and external links it provides. At the end of an article, a reader can find related stories with bold, hyperlinked headlines taking them to another page on the site. This adds to the sites relevancy and consistency. By showcasing external links, Refinery29 adds credibility to its information, especially if it’s linking to other popular, relevant sites. 
</p>
<p>
Lastly, Refinery29 makes it content look visually pleasing to the eye.  The site contains a good balance of high-resolution photos and text (with good line spacing, strong grammar, mechanics, and spelling), along with a lot of third person headings (i.e. “Tracking Your Personal Expenses for 7 Days). The tone is consistent and the information is useful to users who make informed decisions. Content on the site is frequently updated and quick to load. Refinery29 is faster than 63% of sites with an upload speed of 1.475 seconds, according to <a href="https://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/refinery29.com"target="_blank">Alexa</a>. Additional content that is pertinent to the site is also found on the site’s footer: About Us, Press, Advertising, Site Map, RSS, Terms, Privacy, and more. 
</p>
<p>
Overall, it’s hard to find a weakness with Refinery29, but to some users the frequent advertisements can detract from their experience on the site. However, advertisements are another revenue stream for Refinery29 so it must weigh the benefits over the cons of their placement.
